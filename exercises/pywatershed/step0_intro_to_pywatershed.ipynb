    "Hydrologic models help us to understand understand water's role in the environment and how to manage this important resource. At the USGS, hydrologic models have been developed to simulate and predict hydrologic conditions, including streamflow and water availability, at the daily timescale. These models aim to understand how changing climate, weather, and land use will change hydrologic response and conditions.\n",

    "## What is pywatershed?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the [pywatershed documentation on readthedocs](https://pywatershed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): \n",
    "\n",
    "Pywatershed is Python package for simulating hydrologic processes motivated by the need to modernize important, legacy hydrologic models at the USGS, particularly the [Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System](https://www.usgs.gov/software/precipitation-runoff-modeling-system-prms)(PRMS, Markstrom et al., 2015) and its role in [GSFLOW](https://www.usgs.gov/software/gsflow-coupled-groundwater-and-surface-water-flow-model)(Markstrom et al., 2008). The goal of modernization is to make these legacy models more flexible as process representations, to support testing of alternative hydrologic process conceptualizations, and to facilitate the incorporation of cutting edge modeling techniques and data sources. Pywatershed is a place for experimentation with software design, process representation, and data fusion in the context of well-established hydrologic process modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python language was choosen because it is accessible to a wide audience of potential contributors which will help foster community development and experimentation. A large number of advanced libraries available for Python can also be applied to hdyrologic modeling, including libraries for parallelism, data access and manipulation, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the conceptual design of PRMS, pywatershed calculates explicit solutions of spatially distributed hydrologic process representations including evaporation, transpiration, runoff, infiltration, interflow, snowpack, soil moisture, conceptual groundwater storage, and channel flow. These process representations simulate hydrologic response and water budgets given inputs of spatially distributed weather variables and land use change at temporal scales ranging from days to centuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pywatershed enhances PRMS with a new software design that is object-oriented and highly flexible, allowing users to easily run “sub-models”, replace process representations, and incorporate new data. There are base classes which manage mass and energy conservation and the implementation of concrete process classes follows a self-describing design which allows for a Model class to connect hydrologic process classes based on their descriptions of themselves. A variety of input data sources is managed by the Adapter class which implements subclasses for different sources. The design of pywatershed is documented in these docs and also demonstrated by numbered Jupyter Notebooks in the examples/ directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flexible structure of pywatershed helps it to couple with other hydrologic models. We can easily one-way couple pywatershed to [MODFLOW 6](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-6-usgs-modular-hydrologic-model)(MF6, Hughes et al., 2017) via its [XMI interface](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/modflow-application-programming-interface-simulationcontrol-and-software)(Hughes et al., 2022). We are working towards a two-way, tight coupling with MF6 to reproduce GSFLOW. Our goal is support integrated hydrologic process modeling of surface water and groundwater in a sustainable manner that allows individual software components to evolve independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Status\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version 1.0.0 (2023-12-18)\n",
    "With pywatershed version 1.0.0, we have faithfully reproduced the PRMS process representations used in the [USGS National Hydrolgical Model](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/tm6B9)(NHM, Regan et al., 2018). For more information on version 1.0.0 see the [release notes](https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed/releases/tag/1.0.0) and the [extended release notes](https://ec-usgs.github.io/pywatershed/2023/12/18/v1-0-0-overview) for version 1.0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current version: 2.0.0 (unreleased)\n",
    "With pywatershed version 2.0.0, we introduce the `FlowGraph` capabilities that allow users to combine different kinds flow solutions in arbitrary order on a “flow graph”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 2.0.0 also introduces several important PRMS capabilities beyond those included in the National Hydrolgical Model (NHM, Regan et al., 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 2.0.0 also includes capabilties to translate `PRMSChannel` simulations into 1-D diffusive wave simulations in MODFLOW 6’s development branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on version 2.0.0 see the release notes and the extended release notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next major version: 3.0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "This release will include the \"cascading flow\" features of PRMS and GSFLOW. \n",
    "\n",
    "### This class\n",
    "This class comes while the release of pywatershed 2.0 is imminent and likely to be released within a month. The class also comes at a time when a large chunk of version 3.0 is already complete and desirable to use for the class. In the class we will be using features from both version 2.0 and 3.0. However some of the software details may change. Please consult the current document and contact about failing examples when fixes to class notebooks are not obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions in the [SOFTWARE.md](../../SOFTWARE.md) file in the repository root.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install pywatershed\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we want to use a couple of more cutting-edge features in this class, we'll be installing pywatershed from \"source\" using the special branch `feat_gw3099`. When this branch is no longer available, please use pywatershed version 3.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "After activating the environment above, run the following\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd <path_to>/GW3099-2024/exercises/pywatershed\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed.git pywatershed_repo\n",
    "cd pywatershed_repo\n",
    "git checkout feat_gw3099\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see that version 3.0 is available at [https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed/releases](https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed/releases), please delete the repository at `<path_to>/GW3099-2024/exercises/pywatershed/pywatershed_repo` and repeat the above steps but checking out `git checkout v3.0.0` instead of what is listed above. Or, at that time, you can also simply `conda install pywatershed`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learn more about pywatershed\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about pywatershed please visit the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed) and the [readthedocs](https://pywatershed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks in the class are largely based on the notebooks in the [examples/](https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed/tree/develop/examples) directory of the pywatershed repository."

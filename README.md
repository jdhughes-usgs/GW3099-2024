## Course Description
This class will cover many of the advanced MODFLOW 6 capabilities and provide an overview of PEST++ parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis using PEST++. Most of the class will be taught using Flopy and Jupyter Notebooks.  In addition to lectures, most sessions will include in-class exercises to give attendees a better understanding of how to use the modeling tools.

## Overview
* **Monday**: Getting started, Structured and unstructured grids (DIS, DISV, DISU) and LGR; XT3D; Advanced packages (LAK, SFR, MAW, UZF, MVR)
* **Tuesday**: NetCDF; Groundwater Transport (GWT) and associated advanced packages (SFT, UZT, *etc.*), Buoyancy (BUY) and Viscosity (VSC); Groundwater Energy (GWE) and associated advanced packages (SFE, UZE, *etc.*)
* **Wednesday**: Solver settings; Particle Tracking (PRT); Skeletal Storage, Compaction, and Subsidence (CSUB) Package; MODFLOW API
* **Thursday**: pywatershed; MODFLOW API - Coupling Models; Surface Water Flow (SWF); Parallel MODFLOW
* **Friday**: PEST++; Advanced Visualization

## Software

We will be using python during the class to build model datasets, run models, and post-process model results. The software has been installed on the USGS Hovenweep Supercomputer but it would be good to install the software The python on your laptop before the class. Software installation instructions for local installations are provided in [SOFTWARE.md](./SOFTWARE.md). Contact jdhughes@usgs.gov if you have any problems installing the class software.

## Agenda

The following tentative agenda is based on a start time each morning of 8:30 AM and an ending time each day of 4:30 PM.  The agenda may be adjusted during the week in response to student requests.
